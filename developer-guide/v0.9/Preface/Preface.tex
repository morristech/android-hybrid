Working with both Object-Oriented software and Relational Databases can be cumbersome and time consuming. Development costs are significantly higher due to a paradigm mismatch between how data is represented in objects versus relational databases. Siminov is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Android environments. The term Object/Relational Mapping refers to the technique of mapping data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa). See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping} for a good high-level discussion.

Probably the single best background is an understanding of data modeling principles. You might want to consider these resources as a good starting point: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling}\\

Siminov not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQLit Siminov design goal is to relieve the developer from 99% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual, hand-crafted data processing using SQLite. However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Siminov does not hide the power of SQLite from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always.

Siminov may not be the best solution for data-centric applications that only use stored-procedures to implement the business logic in the database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business logic in the Java-based. However, Siminov can certainly help you to remove or encapsulate vendor-specific SQLite code and will help with the common task of result set translation from a tabular representation to a graph of objects.


\section{Get Involved}
