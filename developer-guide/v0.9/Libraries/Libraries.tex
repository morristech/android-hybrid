\chapter {\Large{Handling Libraries}}

An Android library project is a development project that holds shared Android source code and resources. Other Andriod application projects can reference the library project and, at build time, include its compiled sources in their .apk files. Multiple application projects can reference the same library project and any single application project can reference multiple library projects.

Siminov provides mechnism to configure ORM for your library projects.
